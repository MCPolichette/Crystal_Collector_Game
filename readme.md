Crystal Collector
May 8th Homework, REDME.MD

How to play "Crystal Collector":
    Open Crystal Collector and follow directions listed in the Jumbotron.
  
        "You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
        There are four crystals below, By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total
            score.
        
        You win the game by matching your totoal score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above
            the random number.
        The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it
        Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal"

Design Decisions:
    I chose to use nice solid colors and clean similar images and found a drawn background to match.  I also found some "clink" sounds to make improve the experience and slow down the users gameplay.

    I found that even though I was limited to 4 crystals for this project, I challenged myself to make the crystals images change randomly as well, but not end up having duplicates displayed on screen. My comments in the javascript indicate this.

    I challenged myself to get Bootstrap to work for me,  As of writing this README, I havn't been able to make it work well for mobile.

    Using JQUERY worked suprisingly well, I used Google to help find simple solutions, and cleaned up my code as I went along.

    My psuedo-code was spot on, and taking babysteps to make it through was super beneficial.
