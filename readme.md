### Design Decisions

- I chose to use nice solid colors and simple images. I then looked for a drawn background to match. I also found some "clink" sounds to improve the experience and slow down the users gameplay.

* Even though I was limited to 4 crystals for this project, I challenged myself to make the crystals images change randomly as well, but not end up having duplicates displayed on screen. My comments in the javascript indicate this.

* I challenged myself to get Bootstrap to work for me, As of writing this README, I still need to edit some things for mobile.

* Using JQUERY worked suprisingly well, I used Google to help find simple solutions, and cleaned up my code as I went along.

* My psuedo-code was spot on, and taking babysteps to make it through was super beneficial. This was a great learning experience!
